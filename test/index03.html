      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>Hiyo! I'm a Seattle-native recently returned hom after traveling the globe with my family. I graduated from UW in 2009 and began teaching science for a nonprofit, joined the airforce as a korean analyst, and met my husband. We traveled across the country, started our family in Florida, and then moved across the world, adding to our family in Okinawa.</p>
